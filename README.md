# Introduction
#### Author: *Q Adipo*

This project is aimed at testing my mastery of Bootstrap and jQuery. At the end of day the website recreated should be as below:

![Our Website](studio.jpg)

As such the project will also focus on:
1. Create a Hover effect for the **Portfolio** section such that on hover a white box appears with the name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background. 
2. Make the site responsive
3. Tell the user through a pop up that you have received their message and also thank them for contacting you. For example:

    "John Doe we have recieved your message. Thank you for reaching out to us."

3. Use mail chimp API to track all the emails and messages from your users.
